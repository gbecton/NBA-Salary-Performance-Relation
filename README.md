# NBA-Stats-SQL-Tableau-
Using data from the NBA to create a database. I used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to transverse through the dataset using SQL.
Once I was finished with this task I uploaded the data to Tableau to visualize the data in SQL. The end goal of this project is to see which players are being paid
more then they deserve based on their performance seen in data. I will do this by comparing the salary of the highest paid player on the team and in the NBA.

However, I still have not included the salary because I will be putting this info in manually or until I find a dataset to input into the data that I have.
